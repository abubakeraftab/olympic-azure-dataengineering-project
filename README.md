# olympic-azure-dataengineering-project
I have created and developed complete end to end Data Engineering ETL project for Tokyo Olympics Data. The dataset has been extracted from Kaggle and ingested using Azure Data Factory and loaded into Azure Data lake Gen 2. The transformations are applied using Azure Databricks and has been loaded to Azure Synapse Analytics for further data processing using SQL. I have developed insights using PowerBI that helps to provide detailed and accurate information regarding various factors which leads to the evolution of Olympic Games and improvement of Countries/Players over the time in visual format.
